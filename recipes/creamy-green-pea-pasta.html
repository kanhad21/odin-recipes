    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Mint and peas are a natural pairing in this creamy pasta dish. It works
      well as a vegetarian main dish or can be divided into smaller portions as
      a side dish. If you have pine nuts on hand, sprinkle them over the top for
      a little crunch. If you like your pesto to be totally smooth, process it a
      little longer, scraping down the sides of the bowl as you go. Parmesan
      cheese grated fresh with a microplane grater will give you the best
      results.

      <li>
        Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add pasta; cook
        according to package directions, until al dente. Reserve 3/4 cup cooking
        water. Drain the pasta; rinse under cold water. Transfer to a large
        bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1/2 cup Parmesan and 1 teaspoon lemon zest to a small bowl. With
        clean hands, rub the Parmesan and zest together until fragrant, about 30
        seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place peas, mint, oil, lemon juice, salt and the remaining 1 cup
        Parmesan and 2 teaspoons lemon zest in a food processor. Process until
        mostly smooth, 20 to 30 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the pesto and the reserved 3/4 cup cooking water to the pasta; toss
        until coated and creamy. Divide among 6 bowls; top with the
        lemon-Parmesan mixture.
