    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Forget the marble-size meatballs you find in many versions of this Italian
      Wedding Soup. In this easy recipe, they're full-size, full-flavored and
      plenty filling.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>1 ⅓ cups chopped yellow onion</li>
      <li>⅔ cup chopped carrot</li>
      <li>⅔ cup chopped celery</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
      <li>6 cups unsalted chicken broth</li>
      <li>6 ounces orzo, preferably whole-wheat</li>
      <li>1½ tablespoons chopped fresh oregano</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>
        24 cooked chicken meatballs (12 ounces), such as Easy Chicken Meatballs
      </li>
      <li>4 cups baby spinach</li>
      <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high
        heat. Add onion, carrot, celery and garlic; cook, stirring occasionally,
        until the onion is translucent, 4 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add broth, cover and bring to a boil. Add orzo, oregano and salt; cover
        and cook, stirring occasionally, until the orzo is just tender, about 9
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in meatballs and spinach; cook until the meatballs are heated
        through and the spinach is wilted, 2 to 4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve sprinkled with cheese and drizzled with the remaining 3
        tablespoons oil.
      </li>
    </ol>
